                    <p>I am 36 weeks pregnant as of today!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Since I am so far along with this pregnancy I will share some of the resources I have been using to be informed about my first pregnancy. I use this site called <a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/week-35.aspx" target="_blank">What to Expect</a>, to get quick info for the week. This site also has a forum to post questions,
                        and they break down the forums by expected due month. I use the <a href="https://community.whattoexpect.com/forums/august-2025-babies.html" target="_blank">August 2025</a> forum page as another resource for when I have a question or I am curious about something.
                    Another great resource is the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easymobs.pregnancy" target="_blank">Pregnancy App</a> found on the Google Play Store (I currently have a Google Pixel phone). This app is great to write notes on how you are feeling, keep track of baby kicks, there's a weight tracker, a bump gallery to upload photos of belly and much more.
                    I really recommend this app to everyone that is pregnant since it has been so useful to me this year.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>There's a lot of information out there but stick to <strong>trustworthy sources</strong> when it comes to your health and the baby's health.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In NYC there are many private and public resources that can help out first time parents. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://connect.queenslibrary.org/9146#:~:text=Baby%20Basics%20presents%20information%20on,May%2C%20August%2C%20and%20November." target="_blank">Queens Public Library</a>: The Baby Basics class is a 3 part free virtual class and if you complete it, the library will send home a few items for the baby!</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.birthmattersnyc.com/" target="_blank">Birth Matters NYC</a>: I really recommend Lisa's birthing class whether in person in Astoria or over Zoom. The price is a little hefty but well worth it to prepare for what's coming soon.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://yourbabyacademy.com/free-class/free-baby-care-class/" target="_blank">The Baby Academy</a>: This is not a NYC only resource but their free Baby Care class was over Zoom and we learned so much about how to bathe a newborn and how to take care of the umbilical cord and much more. </li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/citywide-doula-initiative.page" target="_blank">The Citywide Doula Initiative</a>: This is a program in NYC and I qualified since I am being seen at a NYC public hospital. I recently expressed interest in a doula and I hope to get matched with one in the next couple of weeks! I believe I will also 
                        get home visits soon through this program. But will post more info once I receive it.</li>
