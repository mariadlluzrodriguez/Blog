                    <p>I am 37 weeks pregnant as of today!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>We went to IKEA on a Wednesday evening to get last minute furniture before the baby arrives. But the day before on Tuesday, I had 
                        my usual weekly prenatal appointment. I told them about how my feet have been itchy since Saturday (I thought it was due to walking 
                        barefoot at the pool on Saturday afternoon) but the midwife took this complaint seriously and sent me to the lab to get blood drawn.
                        She said that itchy feet are a sign of something called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholestasis-of-pregnancy/symptoms-causes/syc-20363257" target="_blank">Cholestasis of pregnancy.</a>
                        She also set up an appointment for Friday for a Non Stress Test (NST) to check on the baby. By Friday, I got my lab results and did the NST. The lab results and NST went well,
                        but I told them that the palm of my hands started to itch and the intensity of the itchiness of my feet had gone up. This concerned the midwifr
                        a bit so I had to go to the lab again and I am scheduled for another NST on Tuesday.
