# Blog
Hi! I'm using this space to practice some of the web development skills I learned last year in class. 
More importantly, this blog is a personal journal capturing a special chapter of my life â€” the final weeks of my pregnancy, 
the birth of our baby, and the incredible first few weeks of life as a new family. It's a mix of reflections, milestones, 
and moments I want to remember and share. Thanks for being here!
